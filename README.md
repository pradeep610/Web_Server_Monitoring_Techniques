# Web-Server-monitoring-Techniques<br/>
An organization has deployed a Windows based web server on its network. The network administrator has to identify the appropriate techniques for analyzing the below parameters.<br/><br/>
-> TCP traffic (Incoming TCP Syn requests, TCP reset connections, TCP established connections,TCP half open connections)<br/>
-> Technique to monitor specific application requests on Web server<br/>
-> Technique to monitor HTTP Get requests to on Web server<br/>
-> Server bandwidth<br/>
-> Port status of the web server<br/><br/>
A combination of different types of tools like Wireshark, nmap, netstat is to be used with appropriate commands and filters identified for achieving the required output.<br/>
<H2>Deliverable:</H2>
-> Technique to monitor TCP SYN requests to the web server with wireshark output</br>
-> Technique to monitor TCP reset connections sent to and from the Web Server with wireshark output</br>
-> Technique to monitor established open connections on a Web Server with netstat output</br>
-> Technique to monitor TCP half open connections on the Web Server with netstat output</br>
-> Technique to monitor requests to a specific application on the Web server with wireshark output</br>
-> Technique to monitor HTTP GET requests to the web server with wireshark output</br>
-> Technique to monitor server bandwidth with netstat output</br>
-> Technique to monitor the port status of a Web Server with nmap output</br>
